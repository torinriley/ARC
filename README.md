# **ARC: Adaptive Reasoning Core**

ARC (Adaptive Reasoning Core) is a foundational large language model (LLM) project designed to optimize the cost and scalability of AI model training while maintaining cutting-edge performance. This project aims to train and deploy an open-source LLM inspired by models like GPT-2 and GPT-3, with a focus on innovation and accessibility.

---

## **Features**
- **Cost-Optimized Training**: Innovative training techniques reduce compute costs by up to 70%.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Seamless use of Hugging Face’s libraries for data processing and model training.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven, allowing contributions and collaborations.
- **Scalable Design**: A model architecture designed to grow iteratively from smaller-scale models (e.g., GPT-2 size) to larger-scale (e.g., GPT-3 size and beyond).
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily adaptable parameters for experimenting with different model sizes, datasets, and training strategies.

---

## **Project Goals**
- Train a foundational LLM with **200M parameters** as a prototype.
- Scale the model iteratively to explore the feasibility of larger architectures.
- Share insights and methods to encourage research and innovation in accessible AI development.


## **Dataset**
The project uses [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), a large-scale dataset designed for training language models. Data is streamed dynamically using Hugging Face’s `datasets` library.

---

## **Model Architecture**
The Transformer model is inspired by GPT-2, with the following customizable parameters:
- **Number of Layers**: Default is 6.
- **Model Dimension (`d_model`)**: Default is 512.
- **Attention Heads**: Default is 8.
- **Feedforward Dimension (`d_ff`)**: Default is 2048.
